## Overview of the Analysis


## The purpose of this assignment was to resample and then compare to data sets for risk assessment.
 
## We used historical lending activity and we wanted to see the data and the credit to determine risk.
 
## We split the data into 2 dataframes x and y and then we split those into 2 more for testing data sets for a total of 4 with train_test_split. We tried to predict loan status.
 
## We followed the four step machine learning process:
## 1. preprocces data
## 2. fit the model
## 3. predict
## 4. evaluate
## using these four steps we 

## Results

## [first test](picture link)
##  The balanced accuracy score of Model 1 is 0.952
## The precision score of the 0 class is 1.0 and 1 class is 0.85.
## The recall scores of the 0 class is 0.99 and 1 class is 0.91.

## [second test](picture link)
## The balanced accuracy score of Model 1 is 0.993
## The precision score of the 0 class is 1.0 and 1 class is 0.84.
## The recall scores of the 0 class is 0.99 and 1 class is 0.99
## Summary

## Conclusion 
## Model 2 did better, it had better scores overall and would better predict risk.
